Baicells Proposed Hardware Solution & known CVE’s, {Ref NIST}:
•	Baicells Nova 436Q: according to CVE-2023-0776 Baicells Nova 436Q LTE TDD eNodeB devices with firmware through QRTB 2.12.7 are vulnerable to remote shell code exploitation via HTTP command injections. Commands are executed using pre-login execution and executed with root permissions. 
•	Baicells Atom CPE: No CVE’s discovered as of 10/23/2024

Baicells Proposal Synopsis (Ref: Baicells Case Study, City of Las Vegas)
Las Vegas is home to over 600,000 residents, but a significant portion—around 20%—struggles with reliable internet access. Key players, including Michael Sherwood, Chief Innovation Officer for Las Vegas, and Chris Craig, Deputy Technologies Director, are working to shift the city’s image from an entertainment hub to a tech-centric epicenter comparable to Silicon Valley. Their vision: bridge the digital divide and establish a robust tech ecosystem.
The initiative involves partnerships with Terranet and Baicells Technologies. Led by Bart van Aardenne and Mike Kerr, Terranet specializes in small private networks, primarily targeting municipal and educational sectors. Baicells provides the critical tech infrastructure through their Nova 436Q base stations and Atom CPEs, which are central to the city’s strategy. Together, these teams are rapidly deploying wireless solutions to underserved areas, with the aim of transforming Las Vegas into a smart city by 2025.
Sherwood highlights that wireless connectivity is fundamental to building a tech-friendly city, noting that federal funding will help expand networks for public safety, education, and other critical areas. The project is essential for supporting residents, especially children who have struggled to stay connected during the pandemic due to insufficient internet access. With almost 30,000 kids lacking high-speed internet, providing these resources has become a top priority.
To tackle these challenges, Baicells, Terranet, and the City of Las Vegas deployed equipment across community centers, identifying locations where broadband access is needed most. They’ve initiated a four-phase plan to expand coverage, ensuring that families can easily connect their homes through pre-programmed CPEs, creating seamless access to private LTE networks.
Baicells’ products stood out for their affordability, quality, and ease of use, making them the ideal partner. As the city progresses, there’s potential for expanding the network further to enhance law enforcement communication, telehealth, and IoT infrastructure as the city gears up for 5G integration.
The initiative is on track to position Las Vegas as a 21st-century tech hub, leveraging Baicells’ future-proofed technology and comprehensive solutions to transform the city’s digital landscape.

Potential Dangers:
The presence of hardcoded credentials in firmware, like the ones found in Baicells Nova 346Q (referenced in NIST CVE-2023-0776), is indeed a significant security risk. Hardcoded credentials can serve as a backdoor, allowing unauthorized access to systems and networks. This is concerning, especially in critical infrastructure devices such as those used for telecommunications.
Potential Government Mandates and Backdoors:
There are ongoing concerns that Chinese companies, especially those involved in technology and telecommunications, may be required by the Chinese government to include backdoors or maintain certain levels of access in their products. China’s National Intelligence Law (enacted in 2017) mandates that Chinese organizations and citizens must support, assist, and cooperate with state intelligence work. This has led to widespread skepticism regarding the security of Chinese-made tech products, particularly in the context of critical infrastructure like 5G and network hardware.
Broader Implications:
This isn't just speculation; governments and cybersecurity agencies in several countries, including the U.S., the UK, and Australia, have expressed concerns. For instance, Huawei has faced bans and restrictions in several markets due to worries about backdoors and potential government influence. The concern is that the Chinese government might mandate or pressure manufacturers to integrate vulnerabilities or provide data access that could be exploited for espionage.
Industry and Government Responses:
To mitigate risks, several governments have either banned or restricted the use of Chinese telecom equipment:
•	The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) placed bans on several Chinese firms, including Huawei and ZTE, citing national security risks due to potential backdoors and government influence.
•	In Europe, some countries have limited the deployment of Huawei’s 5G equipment, preferring alternatives like Ericsson and Nokia to avoid perceived risks.

Baicells' Vulnerability: Cause for Concern?
If the hardcoded credentials in Baicells' firmware are not isolated incidents but rather indicative of broader practices, this would align with ongoing concerns about Chinese influence over tech manufacturers. While it’s not confirmed whether these backdoors are directly mandated by the Chinese government, the risk remains high due to the obligations Chinese firms have under Chinese law.
Recommendations:
•	Firmware Updates: Ensure that any devices using Baicells Nova 346Q firmware are updated to the latest version that addresses this vulnerability (if a patch is available).
•	Network Segmentation: Isolate these devices in the network to limit exposure if an unauthorized party gains access.
•	Security Monitoring: Employ intrusion detection systems (IDS) and monitoring tools to detect unusual activity potentially associated with unauthorized access.
In summary, while there isn't conclusive public evidence that the Chinese government mandates these backdoors specifically, the context provided by Chinese laws and previous cases involving other Chinese tech firms suggests a legitimate reason for concern.
